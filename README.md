Below steps were performed on Tableau to create a Dashboard:<p>
<ul>
<li>Data Exploration: The initial phase involved data cleaning, transformation, and preparation to ensure the data was ready for analysis.</li>
<li>In-Depth Analysis: With the data prepared, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to uncover hidden patterns, trends, and key performance indicators. I examined various dimensions such as product categories, customer segments, and geographic regions to identify opportunities for optimization and improvement. These visualizations not only showcased the insights derived from the data but also enabled users to explore the data on their own. I utilized various chart types, filters, and parameters to enhance the user experience.</li>
<li>Business Insights: Beyond the visuals, I extracted actionable insights from the data analysis. My analysis influenced strategies related to inventory management, customer segmentation, and sales forecasting.</li>
<li>Storytelling: To convey the findings, I used interactive dashboards and explanatory text to engage stakeholders and facilitating decision-making.</li>
</ul>
